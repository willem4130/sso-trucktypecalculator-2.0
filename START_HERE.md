# 🚀 Start Here - Simplicate Integration

Welcome! This guide will get your Simplicate automation system connected to your real Simplicate account in under 10 minutes.

---

## 📖 Overview

This system automates three main workflows:

1. **Contract Distribution** 📄
   - Automatically create and send contracts when team members join projects

2. **Hours Reminders** ⏰
   - Remind team members to submit their hours on schedule

3. **Invoice Generation** 💰
   - Generate invoices based on approved hours (coming soon)

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your API Credentials (2 minutes)

1. Log into your Simplicate account
2. Go to Settings → API
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the **API Key** and **API Secret**

**Need help?** See [SIMPLICATE_API_GUIDE.md](./SIMPLICATE_API_GUIDE.md) for screenshots and detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Add Credentials to .env (1 minute)

Open the `.env` file in your project root and add:

```env
# Simplicate API
SIMPLICATE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
SIMPLICATE_API_SECRET="your-api-secret-here"
SIMPLICATE_DOMAIN="yourcompany.simplicate.com"
```

Replace with your actual values from Step 1.

### Step 3: Test the Connection (1 minute)

Run this command:

```bash
npm run test:simplicate
```

You should see:

```
✓ Connected to Simplicate API successfully!
✓ Found 12 projects
```

**That's it!** You're connected. 🎉

## 🔜 What You Need to Set Up Next

To enable full automation:

### 1. Webhooks (Required for Automation)
Without webhooks, automation won't trigger automatically.

**What you need:**
- A public URL (use ngrok for local testing)
- Configure webhook in Simplicate dashboard

**How long:** 5 minutes

**Guide:** See [GETTING_STARTED.md - Step 5](./GETTING_STARTED.md#step-5-set-up-webhooks-for-automation)

### 2. Email Notifications (Optional)
Send contract emails and hours reminders via email.

**What you need:**
- Resend account (free tier available)
- Verified domain (or use test mode)

**How long:** 10 minutes

**Setup:**
```env
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@yourdomain.com"
```

### 3. Slack Notifications (Optional)
Send notifications to Slack channels.

**What you need:**
- Slack workspace admin access
- Create a Slack app

**How long:** 15 minutes

**Guide:** See [SIMPLICATE_SETUP.md - Step 5](./SIMPLICATE_SETUP.md#step-5-slack-integration-optional)

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

After starting the dev server (`npm run dev`), visit:

**http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard**

You'll see:

1. **Stats Overview**
   - Total projects
   - Active contracts
   - Recent hours

2. **Recent Projects**
   - Synced from Simplicate
   - Click to view details

3. **Automation Logs**

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Do I need a production database?"

**For testing:** No, SQLite (already set up) works fine.

**For production:** Yes, switch to PostgreSQL (Supabase, Neon, etc.)

See [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](./SUPABASE_SETUP.md)

### "Can I use this without webhooks?"

Technically yes, but you'll lose automation benefits. Without webhooks, you need to manually trigger workflows.

### "Is my data safe?"

Yes:
- Credentials stored in `.env` (not committed to git)
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Database is local (or your own hosted instance)
- No third-party data storage

### "What if I don't have Simplicate access?"

You can still develop using mock data. The system will warn but won't crash. Just skip the real API tests.

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Something not working?

1. **Check the logs**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Watch the terminal for errors
   ```

2. **Test your connection**
   ```bash
   npm run test:simplicate
   ```

3. **Check environment variables**
   ```bash
   cat .env | grep SIMPLICATE
   ```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Cannot connect to API" | Check credentials in `.env` |
| "Webhooks not working" | Verify webhook URL in Simplicate |
| "Database locked" | Close Prisma Studio, restart dev server |
| "Email not sending" | Check Resend API key |
