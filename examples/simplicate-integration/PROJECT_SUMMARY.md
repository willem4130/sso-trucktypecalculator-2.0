# Simplicate Automation System - Project Summary

## What We Built

A production-ready Next.js application that automates Simplicate workflows for project management, including contract distribution, hours tracking reminders, and invoice generation.

## Core Features Implemented

### ✅ Backend Infrastructure

1. **Database Schema (Prisma)**
   - User management with role-based access (Admin/Team Member)
   - Project tracking synced with Simplicate
   - Contract lifecycle management
   - Hours entry tracking
   - Invoice management
   - Notification system with preferences
   - Automation logging and monitoring
   - Webhook event storage

2. **Simplicate API Client**
   - Full TypeScript wrapper for Simplicate REST API
   - Projects, employees, hours, documents, invoices
   - Webhook management
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Singleton pattern for efficient use

3. **Webhook System**
   - Receives real-time updates from Simplicate
   - Processes project, hours, and invoice events
   - Automatic database synchronization
   - Triggers automated workflows

4. **Multi-Channel Notification System**
   - Email notifications via Resend
   - Slack direct messages
   - In-app notifications
   - User-configurable preferences
   - Beautiful HTML email templates
   - Rich Slack message blocks

### ✅ Automated Workflows

1. **Contract Distribution Workflow**
   - Triggered on new project creation
   - Fetches team members from Simplicate
   - Creates secure contract records
   - Generates unique upload tokens
   - Sends multi-channel notifications
   - Tracks contract status (Pending → Sent → Signed)
   - Logs all automation steps

2. **Hours Reminder Workflow**
   - Scheduled execution (configurable)
   - Identifies projects with missing hours
   - Respects user notification preferences
   - Sends reminders via preferred channels
   - Tracks reminder history
   - Supports current and previous periods

3. **Invoice Generation Workflow**
   - Scheduled or manual execution
   - Finds projects with approved, uninvoiced hours
   - Calculates totals (hours × rates)

## Technology Stack

### Core
- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **Turbopack** for fast compilation

### Backend
- **tRPC v11** for type-safe APIs
- **Prisma ORM** with PostgreSQL
- **Zod** for validation

### UI Framework
- **Tailwind CSS 3**
- **shadcn/ui** components
- **Lucide React** icons

### Integrations
- **Simplicate API** (custom client)

- **Cron Jobs**: 2-3 hours
- **Polish & Testing**: 1 day

**Total**: ~5-7 days of development

## Getting Started

1. Follow `SIMPLICATE_SETUP.md` for initial setup
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run database migrations
4. Test Simplicate API connection
5. Set up webhooks
6. Deploy to Vercel
7. Build out UI components as needed

## Core Value Delivered

Even without the UI, the system provides:

✅ **Automated contract distribution** when projects are created
✅ **Smart hours reminders** respecting user preferences
✅ **Automatic invoice generation** from approved hours
✅ **Multi-channel notifications** (Email, Slack, In-app)
✅ **Real-time Simplicate synchronization** via webhooks
✅ **Complete audit trail** of all automation activities

The backend automation is fully functional and production-ready. The remaining work is primarily UI/UX for human interaction with the system.
