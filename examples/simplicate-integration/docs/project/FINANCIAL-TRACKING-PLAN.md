# Financial Tracking System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Build a comprehensive financial tracking system for Simplicate Automations that tracks revenue, costs, and margins at the lowest granularity (project-service-employee level).

### Business Requirements
1. **Rate Types**:
   - Blended hourly rates (T&M projects)
   - Fixed prices (staged invoicing)
   - Co-owner rates: sales tariff + purchase tariff (~10% lower for internal BV)
   - Freelancer rates: project-specific, may vary
   - Software licenses

2. **Core Goal**: Track at project-service-employee level for accurate margins

3. **Invoice Matching**: Match sales invoices and purchase invoices with hours

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Bug Fix - Hours Sync Date Parsing
**Goal**: Fix the Invalid Date errors in hours sync

**Issue**: Some hours entries have `start_date` in a format that causes `new Date()` to return Invalid Date.

#### Tasks
- [ ] Fix date parsing in syncHours() to handle edge cases
- [ ] Re-sync hours to fix affected entries
- [ ] Verify no more Invalid Date errors

#### Files to Modify
- `src/server/api/routers/sync.ts`

---

### Phase 1: Schema Extensions & Employee Sync
**Goal**: Add financial fields to schema and sync employee rates from Simplicate

#### Tasks
- [ ] Add `EmployeeType` enum (CO_OWNER, FREELANCER, INTERNAL)
- [ ] Add to User model: `employeeType`, `defaultSalesRate`, `defaultCostRate`, `salesRateOverride`, `costRateOverride`
- [ ] Extend ProjectMember: rename `hourlyRate` → `salesRate`, add `costRate`
- [ ] Extend HoursEntry: add `costRate`, `revenue`, `cost`, `margin`, `rateSource`
- [ ] Create `ServiceEmployeeRate` model for most granular rate overrides
- [ ] Update `syncEmployees()` to fetch `hourly_cost_tariff`, `hourly_sales_tariff`, `type.label`
- [ ] Update SimplicateEmployee interface in client.ts

#### Files to Modify
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/server/api/routers/sync.ts`
- `src/lib/simplicate/client.ts`

---

### Phase 2: Rate Resolution System
**Goal**: Implement rate hierarchy and resolution logic

#### Rate Hierarchy (Priority Order)
1. Service-Employee Rate (most specific)
2. Project-Member Rate
3. User Override
4. User Default (synced from Simplicate)
5. Simplicate hours.tariff (snapshot)

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create `src/lib/rates/resolver.ts` with `resolveEffectiveRates()`
- [ ] Create `src/server/api/routers/rates.ts` for rate CRUD
- [ ] Add purchase rate calculation (% discount for co-owners)
- [ ] Add rate validation utilities
- [ ] Add `RateAuditLog` model for change tracking

#### Files to Create
- `src/lib/rates/resolver.ts`
- `src/server/api/routers/rates.ts`

---

### Phase 3: Enhanced Hours Sync
**Goal**: Capture full tariff data and calculate financials on sync

#### Tasks
- [ ] Update `syncHours()` to capture `tariff`, `employee_tariff`, `type_tariff`
- [ ] Calculate and store `revenue`, `cost`, `margin` per hours entry
- [ ] Store `rateSource` to track which rate was used
- [ ] Update `syncServices()` to store `hourTypeTariffs` JSON

#### Files to Modify
- `src/server/api/routers/sync.ts`

---

### Phase 4: Financial Dashboard UI
**Goal**: New /admin/financials page with drill-down views

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create `/admin/financials/page.tsx`
- [ ] Create `src/server/api/routers/financials.ts`
- [ ] Implement summary stats cards (revenue, cost, margin, margin %)
- [ ] Implement Project → Service → Employee drill-down table
- [ ] Add filters: date range, projects, employees, clients, billable
- [ ] Extend filter presets for financials page
- [ ] Register financials router in root.ts

#### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/app/admin/financials/page.tsx` (new)
- `src/server/api/routers/financials.ts` (new)
- `src/server/api/root.ts`

---

### Phase 5: Hours Page Enhancement
**Goal**: Add financial columns to existing Hours page

#### Tasks
- [ ] Add "Rate" column to employee rows
- [ ] Add "Revenue" column (hours × rate)
- [ ] Add subtotals per service and project
- [ ] Add billable filter option

#### Files to Modify
- `src/app/admin/hours/page.tsx`
- `src/server/api/routers/hours.ts`

---

### Phase 6: Employee Financial View
**Goal**: Employee-centric financial reporting

#### Tasks
- [ ] Add employee breakdown to financials page
- [ ] Show per-employee: revenue, hours, utilization
- [ ] Show project breakdown per employee
- [ ] Prepare data for purchase invoice generation

---

### Phase 7: Invoice Matching
**Goal**: Link hours to invoices and identify discrepancies

#### Tasks
- [ ] Add `purchaseInvoiceId` to HoursEntry
- [ ] Track which hours are in sales invoices
- [ ] Track which hours are in purchase invoices
- [ ] Create reconciliation queries
- [ ] Build discrepancy alert system

---

### Phase 8: Rate Management UI
**Goal**: Admin interface for rate overrides

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create rate override management page
- [ ] Allow setting rates at user, project, service-employee levels
- [ ] Show rate audit history
- [ ] Add rate validation warnings

## API Endpoints Summary

### financials.ts (new router)
- `getFinancialSummary` - Overview stats with filters
- `getProjectFinancials` - Project drill-down with services/employees
- `getEmployeeFinancials` - Employee-centric view
- `getMonthlyTrend` - Time series data
- `getUninvoicedHours` - Hours not yet billed

### rates.ts (new router)
- `getRateOverrides` - List overrides for user/project/service
- `createRateOverride` - Add new override
- `updateRateOverride` - Modify override
- `deleteRateOverride` - Remove override
- `getRateAuditLog` - View change history
- `resolveRate` - Get effective rate for calculation

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual Rate Model**: Every level stores salesRate (revenue) and costRate (cost)
2. **Override vs Default**: Overrides take precedence, defaults sync from Simplicate
3. **Rate Snapshots**: HoursEntry stores rates at time of sync for historical accuracy
4. **Source Tracking**: Track where each rate came from for audit
5. **Co-owner Purchase Rate**: Default 10% discount from sales, with override capability

## Continuation Prompt

When starting a new session, use this prompt:

```
I'm continuing work on the Financial Tracking System for Simplicate Automations.

Read these files for context:
- docs/project/FINANCIAL-TRACKING-PLAN.md (full plan)
- docs/project/FINANCIAL-TRACKING-TASKS.md (current progress)
- CLAUDE.md (project overview)

Continue from where I left off. After completing each task:
1. Check off the task in FINANCIAL-TRACKING-TASKS.md
2. Run npm run typecheck
3. Commit with /commit and push to production

The goal is tracking revenue, costs, and margins at project-service-employee level.
```
