# Simplicate Automations - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

A comprehensive automation system for Simplicate that handles:
- **Contract Distribution** - Auto-send contracts when employees join projects
- **Hours Reminders** - Smart reminders with budget insights
- **Purchasing Invoices** - Employees invoice SCEX with hours + km + expenses
- **Expense Tracking** - Full km and expense management
- **Management Dashboards** - Budget vs actual reporting

**Production URL**: https://simplicate-automations.vercel.app/
**Repository**: Git main branch, auto-deploys to Vercel

---

## Architecture

**Hybrid Event-Driven**:
- Simplicate Webhooks for real-time triggers
- Vercel Cron for scheduled tasks (every minute)
- PostgreSQL for local data sync
- Push updates back to Simplicate

---

## User Requirements (Confirmed)

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Hourly rates | Sync from Simplicate + allow override |
| Purchasing invoices | Generate draft OR upload own PDF |
| Expenses | Full: Hours + KM + other categories |
| Contract templates | Upload to app + fetch from Simplicate |
