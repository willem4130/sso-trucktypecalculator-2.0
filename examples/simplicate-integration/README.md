# Simplicate Integration Example

This directory contains the complete Simplicate integration that was removed from the main template to keep it minimal and reusable for future projects.

## What Was Included

This was a production-ready Simplicate automation system featuring:

- **Contract Distribution** - Automated contract email distribution to project team members
- **Hours Tracking** - Weekly reminders and comprehensive hours reporting
- **Invoice Generation** - Automated invoice creation from project data
- **Financial Tracking** - Revenue, cost, and margin analysis
- **Mileage Tracking** - Expense and mileage rate calculations
- **Inbound Email Processing** - Email parsing and automation
- **Employee Portal** - Self-service portal for team members
- **Workflow Automation** - Queue-based processing system

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **API Client**: Full Simplicate REST API integration (`src/lib/simplicate/client.ts`)
- **Database**: 27 Prisma models for projects, hours, invoices, contracts, workflows
- **tRPC Routers**: 22 specialized routers for business logic
- **Automation**: Webhook receivers, cron jobs, queue processing

### Key Components
- `/src/lib/simplicate/` - Complete API client library
- `/src/lib/workflows/` - Business workflow implementations
- `/src/lib/rates/` - Multi-tier rate resolution system
- `/src/server/api/routers/` - 19 business-specific tRPC routers
- `/src/app/admin/` - 15+ admin pages for management

## Using This Example

If you need Simplicate integration for a new project:

1. Copy relevant files from this directory back to the main template
2. Add Simplicate environment variables to `.env`:
   ```
   SIMPLICATE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   SIMPLICATE_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   SIMPLICATE_DOMAIN=your-company.simplicate.com
   ```
3. Restore database models from `docs/project/SCHEMA-ADDITIONS.md`
4. Follow setup instructions in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)

## Production Implementation

This was originally built for **scex.nl** and deployed at:
- Production: `https://simplicate-automations.vercel.app/`
- Repository: Originally at `nextjs-fullstack-template`

The implementation was fully functional with:
- Real-time webhook processing
- Automated email sending via Resend
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Vercel cron jobs for scheduled tasks

## Notes

This is a complete, production-tested implementation. Feel free to use it as a reference or starting point for similar integrations with Simplicate or other business management platforms.
