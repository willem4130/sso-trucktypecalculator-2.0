### Pending Tasks

---

## Key Decisions Made

**Email Testing Policy**
- **Choice**: Only use willem@scex.nl for all email testing
- **Rationale**: Avoid spamming real users during development
- **Impact**: Documented in CLAUDE.md for future sessions

**Help Documentation Location**
- **Choice**: Central /admin/help page with accordion sections + tooltips
- **Rationale**: User preferred help page over inline-only help
- **Impact**: Created comprehensive Dutch documentation

**Authentication Deferred**
- **Choice**: Skip auth for now, focus on testing and docs
- **Rationale**: User wants to test functionality first
- **Impact**: Auth with email/password will be added later

---

## Files Modified

### Created
- `src/app/admin/help/page.tsx` - Dutch help documentation with accordion UI
- `src/components/ui/accordion.tsx` - shadcn accordion component

### Modified
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Added HelpCircle icon import and Help nav item
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added Testing Rules, Environment Variables, Useful URLs sections

## Architecture Notes

**Email System**:
- Uses Resend (resend.com) for transactional emails
- Environment: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`
- Sent emails tracked in `SentEmail` table
- Test command: `curl -s -X POST "https://simplicate-automations.vercel.app/api/trpc/hoursReport.sendReport" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"json":{"employeeId":"cmiigv6fp000cjp045dym3457","month":"2025-11"}}'`

**Help Page Structure**:
- Accordion-based expandable sections
- Each section covers one feature area
- FAQ at bottom for common questions
- Links to relevant pages within documentation
